## Technical Implementation

**Core Technologies:**
- React with TypeScript (90%+ type coverage)
- Web Audio API for real-time sound synthesis
- Tailwind CSS for responsive UI design
- Netlify for optimized deployment

**Key Technical Achievement:**

Implemented a real-time audio synthesis engine using the Web Audio API, handling keyboard event capture, note mapping, and audio context management to create a responsive musical instrument with minimal latency. The system processes keyboard inputs and translates them into synthesizer controls with performance optimized for live playability.

**Engineering Highlights:**
- Dual input modes: keyboard event handling and click-based interaction
- Real-time audio synthesis with Web Audio API oscillators and envelope control
- Type-safe React components with comprehensive TypeScript coverage
- Optimized production build with code splitting and caching strategies
- Responsive design for various screen sizes and input methods

## Skills

- **Audio Programming**: Web Audio API, sound synthesis, real-time audio processing
- **Event Handling**: Complex keyboard input mapping, event debouncing
- **React Development**: Component architecture, state management, effects
- **TypeScript**: Strong typing, type safety across audio contexts
- **UI/UX Design**: Interactive musical interface, visual feedback systems
- **Performance Optimization**: Audio latency minimization, efficient rendering
