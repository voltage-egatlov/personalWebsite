An ergonomic study evaluating how everyday products accommodate diverse body types using anthropometric data. This project examined an oven/stove unit and a Tide Pods container to identify design decisions that affect usability across different user populations.

**Course:** ENP-114 | **Completed:** October 2024 | **Collaborator:** Silas Clark

## Project Overview

Using standardized anthropometric databases (2012 US Army Personnel Survey), this analysis measured critical interaction points on two household products and calculated which percentiles of the population they accommodate. The goal was to understand how design dimensions impact accessibility and identify potential safety or usability concerns.

## Products Analyzed

### Oven/Stove Unit
Evaluated control placement, stovetop height, and reach requirements to determine accommodation ranges. Found that while the design successfully serves nearly all users within measured ranges, it introduces safety risks (burn hazards) for users in lower percentiles who must reach over hot surfaces.

**Key Finding:** Products can be technically "accessible" while still creating safety concerns for edge cases.

### Tide Pods Container
Analyzed handle dimensions, lid diameter, and opening size relative to hand measurements. Discovered that the restricted opening (3.5 inches) excludes ~50% of male hand sizes—a deliberate design choice prioritizing child safety over universal usability.

**Key Finding:** Design constraints often represent intentional trade-offs between competing priorities (safety vs. accommodation).

## Methodology

- Cross-referenced product dimensions with standardized anthropometric databases
- Calculated percentile accommodation ranges for each interface point
- Identified design trade-offs and their implications for different user groups
- Documented where "inclusive design" conflicts with other requirements (safety, manufacturing)

## Key Takeaways

**Design is about trade-offs, not perfection.** The Tide Pods container sacrifices usability for larger-handed users to prevent child access—a conscious engineering decision where safety trumps universal accommodation.

**Percentiles reveal edge cases.** Products designed for "average" users can create significant problems for people at distribution extremes, even if they represent small percentages.

**Measurement reveals assumptions.** Quantifying accommodation makes implicit design decisions explicit, allowing intentional choices rather than accidental exclusion.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Anthropometric data analysis using standardized databases
- Percentile-based design evaluation
- Identification of design trade-offs between competing requirements
- Technical measurement and documentation protocols
- Critical analysis of inclusive design principles
