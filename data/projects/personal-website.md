description: "A portfolio site featuring realistic cardstock texture rendering with Next.js 16"
---

A portfolio site that demonstrates technical depth through visual craft. Built with Next.js 16, featuring a custom business card component with physically-accurate cardstock texture rendering using normal maps and real-time lighting calculations.

## Technical Implementation

**Core Technologies:**
- Next.js 16 (App Router) with React 19 Server Components
- TypeScript (strict mode) with comprehensive type safety
- Custom canvas-based rendering engine
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling system

**Key Technical Achievement:**
Developed a modular texture rendering library that simulates realistic cardstock using computer graphics techniques typically found in game engines. The system decodes normal maps (RGB-encoded surface vectors) and applies Lambertian reflectance models per-pixel to generate dynamic, high-fidelity paper textures at runtime.

**Engineering Highlights:**
- Designed clean separation between rendering logic and component layer
- Implemented performance optimizations (image caching, pre-computed light vectors)
- Built fully type-safe API with pure functional lighting calculations
- Documented architectural decisions for long-term maintainability

## Skills
- **Frontend Architecture**: Modern React patterns, Server Components, modular library design
- **Computer Graphics**: Normal mapping, lighting models, canvas rendering optimization
- **TypeScript Expertise**: Advanced type systems, strict mode compliance
- **Performance Engineering**: Caching strategies, runtime optimization
- **Visual Design**: Attention to detail, color theory, responsive scaling
